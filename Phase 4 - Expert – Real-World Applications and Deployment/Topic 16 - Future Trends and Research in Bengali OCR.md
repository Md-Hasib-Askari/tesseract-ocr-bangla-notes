# 📘 Topic 16: Future Trends and Research in Bengali OCR

Bengali OCR is rapidly evolving with the rise of **deep learning**, **language models**, and **cross-lingual resources**. This final topic explores the **cutting-edge trends, active research**, and where the field is headed.

## 🚀 1. Transformer-Based OCR

Recent advances in Vision + Language models are shaping OCR’s future:

### 🔍 Examples:

* **TrOCR** (by Microsoft) — Transformer-based end-to-end OCR model
* **Donut** — OCR-free document understanding
* **LayoutLM / DocFormer** — OCR + Layout + NLP

### 🧠 Benefits:

* Higher accuracy than Tesseract for complex layouts
* Integrates text recognition with context understanding

### ⚙️ Bengali Application:

You can fine-tune multilingual transformers like **mTrOCR** on Bengali datasets.

## 🌐 2. Multilingual & Cross-Lingual OCR Models

Projects like:

* **IndicOCR**
* **IndicTrans**
* **BART-based Indic models**

...are training models that **support multiple Indian scripts**, including Bengali.

### 📘 Use case:

* OCR + translation
* Cross-script document conversion
* Smart keyboards and input methods

## 🧠 3. Intelligent Post-OCR Correction (with NLP)

Rather than just rule-based spell-check:

* Use **BERT**, **IndicBERT**, or **GPT models** to correct context-aware spelling/grammar.
* Build Bengali **language models** trained on Wikipedia + news data.

Example: "মই দিলাম" → "আমি দিলাম" (contextual fix)

## 🧾 4. Document Understanding

Beyond text extraction:

* **Key-value pair extraction**
* **Table understanding**
* **Form parsing**

Libraries: Donut, LayoutParser, DeepForm, PaddleOCR

## 📸 5. Real-Time Mobile OCR

Emerging trend: **on-device OCR** using lightweight CNN + RNN models or TensorFlow Lite.

Use cases:

* Scanning handwritten forms
* Voice-to-text in Bengali via camera input
* Augmented reality translation
